# Metaheuristic-Based Process Scheduling

A **Java-based CPU scheduling simulator** that implements both **traditional scheduling algorithms** and **metaheuristic approaches** to compare efficiency, CPU utilization, and performance metrics. Designed with an **interactive GUI** for easy visualization of process execution.

## üìå Features
- **Traditional Scheduling Algorithms:**
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive & Non-Preemptive)
- **Metaheuristic Algorithms:**
  - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
  - Genetic Algorithm (GA)
  - Simulated Annealing (SA)
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - CPU Utilization
- **Interactive GUI** for algorithm selection and visualization
- **Gantt Chart** generation for each algorithm
